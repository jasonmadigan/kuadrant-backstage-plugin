/**
 * permission definitions for the kuadrant plugin
 *
 * these permissions control access to kuadrant resources and operations.
 * they must match the permissions defined in the backend plugin.
 *
 * permission types:
 * - BasicPermission: standard permission that applies globally
 * - ResourcePermission: permission scoped to specific resource types (e.g., apiproduct)
 *
 * permission patterns:
 * - `.create` - create new resources
 * - `.read` - read resource details
 * - `.read.own` - read only resources owned by the user
 * - `.read.all` - read all resources regardless of ownership
 * - `.update` - modify existing resources
 * - `.delete` - delete resources
 * - `.delete.own` - delete only resources owned by the user
 * - `.delete.all` - delete any resource regardless of ownership
 * - `.list` - list/view collections of resources
